### Hello and Welcome!

My name is Emily and I am an aspiring data scientist in Chicago, IL.
I have a background in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
During my time at UIUC my interest in computer science and working with data grew and pushed me
towards the extremely vast and diverse field of data science.

I have always been filled with curiosity and am always seeking to learn new things.
Currently, I am learning data science through the Metis Data Science Program. Along the way,
I intend to post my project progressions to share the new things I have learned as well as my
experience with Metis.

I update my Github more frequently than this blog, so if you'd like to know what I'm
currently working on, I suggest taking a look at my [Github](https://github.com/emilyng) page!

My favorite genre of books and movies are mystery and suspense! To me, data science feels like
being a detective that takes data as clues that build up to a complete picture. Data science allows
us to answer complicated questions and provide conclusions to drive difficult decision making.
